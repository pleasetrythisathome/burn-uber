Atlantis,,4:30 Sector - 4:00-5:30,4:30 and 4:30 Portal (between Esplanade and Awe),"ATLANTIS, THE FORGOTTEN CITY, REDUX.

Today, the legendary city of Atlantis has fallen and many millennia have passed.  In the deep far future of the playa, even the name Atlantis has been forgotten.  All that remains are ancient artifacts used by the inhabitants in radical rituals.  We don’t understand where or when these sacred artifacts came from or what they mean.  But they have been discovered…and we are inexplicably drawn to these objects…we worship them.

As a rite of passage, pilgrims from all over the playa flock to the Towers of Atlantis for a week once a year to worship the sun god and his siblings.  The unbearable intensity of his sight will be shaded by a pleasing geometric covering that will be a gathering spot for deep house music dance rituals. Other forgotten gods’ artifacts have been resurrected and reclaimed from the seas, however, they seem corrupted by the sands of time. 

GORGEOUS SUNSETS, IRRESISTIBLE MUSIC, AND AMAZING PEOPLE.  
 
These themes have been our core throughout the five years of Atlantis.  We’ve met and bonded with so many new friends, dancing at our sunset parties, watching the sunlight fade over the playa, being present and experiencing the now.

THERE IS A STRANGE AND UNIQUE GRAVITY TO ATLANTIS…IT DRAWS PEOPLE IN.
 
Atlantis lost its virginity in 2012.  We knew nothing back then and yet we saw how those experiences, good and bad, brought strangers together.  Campmates and neighbors who had never met, worked with one another and solved problems… with respect and love.  Then we climbed up on trucks to watch the sunset and party together.  Someone thought out loud, “this is what the world needs, and it needs to be shared”.

WE’VE BEEN BACK EVERY YEAR SINCE, HELPING PEOPLE SMILE AND DANCE.  ","Monday - Sunset Party - 5-9PM

Founded in Kuala Lumpur in 1938, our “runs” are based on the child's game ""The Hare and the Hound"" only with a slight adult twist. Hashing requires one or more “hares” to mastermind and set a running trail. With a small head start, the “hare” lays a trail traditionally using flour or chalk, however on-playa hares use strictly survey flags that are swept after trail is complete. A group of ""hounds"" leaves shortly after. The trail involves trickery to deceive the hounds, as well as to keep the pack together. The reward for such a game involves beer stops along the way (for those over 21), either by the hounds discovering caches of beer hidden along the way, or stops at a bar or theme camp, where time is given to socialize before the trail sets off again. Your average hash trail is about 3-6 miles long, and also ends with a cold adult beverage and singing songs full of creative innuendo.

Our camp theme centers around our heritage as hashers. Our goal is to introduce burners to hashing as well as introduce Burning Man and the 10 principles to hashers new to the event.

Camp Fuego No Mercy Karaoke,,6:00 Sector - 5:30-6:30,6:15 and Hallowed,"Camp Fuego's namesake is its Art Installation, ""Fuego"", an arresting life-sized stretched barbed-wire prancing HORSE with flame effects coming from her eyes and mane. Day and night, Fuego's raised head eyes passers-by, who stop to admire burner Cadie Enmark's debut art piece and are drawn into Camp Fuego. Fuego has been to the playa every year since 2007.

Camp Fuego hosts the F.U.Ego Bar, the No Mercy Stage, the Fuego Lounge and the Backstage VIP Lounge, housed in 80x30' of deep shade. We serve BRC's only organic snow cones and are open daily.

The F.U.Ego Bar generously serves a full assortment of top shelf booze &amp;mixers and ice cold craft beer and hard cider. Pick your poison or refresh with an Italian Soda, electrolyte-rich Gatorade or endless organic snow cones. Stay awhile, have another. There are no limits at the F.U.Ego Bar.

The Fuego No Mercy Stage presents DJs from around the globe and hosts an Open Mic and the No Mercy Karaoke Challenge. Every karaoke singer must sign the No Mercy Contract: ""I agree to all No Mercy rules which allows anyone to cut off any singer at anytime. [ ______ Playa Name here]"". Neighbors love Fuego's No Mercy Stage because ""No Mercy"" means any listener can end any unpleasant sound at any time--a missed note, fade to dance music! All in good fun. If we're feeling generous, and a singer can be salvaged, ""Mo' Mercy"" Karaoke might kick in: well-keyed voices chime in, mic volumes adjust and the performance sounds great! The No Mercy Stage also presents spoken word, literary projects, and is open to any manner of stage performance.

Everyone who takes Fuego's No Mercy Stage is a winner. Even those immediately cut off under the No Mercy Contract gain immediate special access to the Backstage VIP Lounge where you can lounge in icy air-conditioning on sheepskin sipping Black Label or Patron. Some singers sing a few notes just to be cut off and gain access! Singers who crush it through their entire song gain access for themselves and their entire crew.

The Fuego Lounge provides shade, hammocks, seating and dancing around our stage and bar. Guests are even invited to dance on our bar. Fuego's Slack Line operates 24/7 and Fuego's Fire Pit warms visitors in the cool pre-dawn hours. The stage and bar open daily from approximately 11am to 3 pm and during the evenings several nights of the week, especially Burn night. Guests are invited to take the stage, dance on the bar or chill in the air-conditioned Backstage Lounge.

Fuego's stage hosts 4 cordless microphones reaching 100' from the stage, accommodating guests with mobility limitations. First-time Burners receive special welcome and are invited to take the stage, come behind the bar, inscribe the Lounge Walls or simply make themselves at home. The Fuego Stage has an Open Mic policy, inviting diverse performances and celebrating authenticity and inclusion; Fuego has hosted literary projects, rap performances, dance parties, karaoke, spoken word and bands.

Camp Fuego celebrates gender and sexual fluidity and nonconformity in our stage performances and in the dress, lifestyles and costuming of its individual members.

Camp Fuego strictly enforces a 21+ only policy for alcohol and serves those adults generously.","Karaoke, Snowcones, and Bar open M-F 11am to 3pm plus whenever we feel like it!",,,

Not just to talk, eat, and enjoy each others’ company, but to gather your collective energy on behalf of your vision and values. Take some time to celebrate the human rites of music, art, dance, drum, song, and story. Revel in a direct experience of At-Onement. Build a supportive network and shared infrastructure that helps sustain you all physically, emotionally, and spiritually. The Cleu vision is that of a world in harmony, where we are At-One with the miracles we depend on: Universe, Earth, Life, Consciousness.

Explore creative and effective ways to support action on behalf of the Earth, Life, and Consciousness. Get a deeper understanding of the universal language of Science. Learn more about the scientific method, investigative journalism, and academic credibility so that you can better distinguish fact from fiction. Value truth, equality, respect and love for all life on our precious planet, a pale blue dot in an amazing Universe. Come together to empower a new paradigm of Truth, Love, and Science. Resist ignorance, injustice, and lies. Learn to prioritize better choices for Air, Water, Food, and Energy. Discover the egalitarian, creative power of the circle.

When you are ready, you could even use the religious freedom granted by the first Amendment of the Bill of Rights to turn your circle into a legal church with its own gathering place, school, garden, library, and childcare. Did you know that you can donate half your income to a church of your choice? What if your church was made up of your friends and community? You could rent a gathering place, go on a pilgrimage together, or buy a set of drums, music equipment, or art supplies for your celebrations. You could apply for faith-based federal funding for social services, engage in community development activities, or start your own church-sponsored businesses, such as bookstores, coffee shops, and retreat centers, mostly tax-exempt and free from government interference.

BlackSKYwhite Show BlackSKYwhite's performances are magical sights - incorporating organic actor's bodily movements, music reaching from electronics to cabaret and ethnic style as well as stunning lighting effects which create a surreal world of great illusion, yet at the same time, a world that is very close and true. blackSKYwhite have created, and continue to create a special technique of placing actors on the edge between reality and illusion - where performances are more of a dream than anything resembling real life. It is difficult to identify the genre of this theatre's stagings (as the word ""genre"" in itself implies some kind of traditionalism) and perhaps the company's style is closest to modern choreography in its most nonconformist form. The shows tell no story, reveal no plot, have no dimensions, or narrative. Rather, they mirror reality through dreams, bordering on that thin line between the outer and the inner worlds that interacts with the spectator through their own intuition or unconsciousness. As in the 'absolute mirror', every single person should see in each their work, an inner world and their own particular destiny. blackSKYwhite has received important awards for innovation in theater at FringeFirst - the international performing arts festival in Edinburgh, Scotland and have headlined performances at Glastronbury Festival. They have performed at Burning Man 2010 also.

Whether it’s the parent that needs a couple of minutes to themselves, a close embrace after a long night of drinking, the morning expulsion of fluids and matter, a young woman coming to learn of her transformation, or just a quick pee- the toilet is the ever present and sacrificial lamb to a clean and sanitary living.
The toilet stands 5 feet tall made of CNC plywood.
Morning Ritual will be placed near the 9 o'clock radial surrounding the Man. It is part of over 30 different art projects celebrating the sacred new age shrines of Burning Man 2017's theme: Radical Ritual. Larry Harvey himself hand picked our shrine, along with other members of the decision making team.
Morning Ritual will burn the night of the Man Burn on Sept 2nd after 9 pm following the fire processional.

Safari Bar - a long time Kegel staple, has now moved under shade. Our semi-professional mixologists (meaning: every one of them has been to a bar lately and one of them is a real life engineer…..so, similar…) will reach under the dusty counters and craft the most excellent of cocktails (read: grab whatever he or she can find under the bar). What better way to wash away the dust of a long Playa journey and ease you from daytime into the beautiful Black Rock City twighlight? Open daily from 5pm ish to...........

Over the bar (and available 24/7) is the Central Lounge - a 20' x 30'+ shade structure with ample seating, musical instruments and mystery stuff that people always seem to leave behind...close enough to the Safari bar that no one will notice your otherwise vampiritic tendencies while trying to stay in the shade.

Our 6th (we think) Annual Grilled Cheese and Baconstravaganza is a wonderful way to commune with friends old and new while defying the latest in healthy eating fashions. Grilled Cheese, lovingly and freshly made to order with - or without - the decadence of heavenly smelling bacon. For those VIP guests (please present your 'VIP' pass) there is the added 'Joy of Sriracha' experience to spice your way into the weekend.

Back for 2018, the toughest game in the Playaverse. Kegel Kommandos and the Lake Lahontan Water Ski Club present the Black Rock City, Ding Dong, Sing Song, Beer Bong, Ping Pong World Championships. Offering you a chance to play a very serious, Championship-level game of table tennis while eating Ding Dongs, and doing Beer Bongs at every 7 points. A win in the game can only be claimed by demonstrating your singing ability after crushing your opponent on the table. Presented alongside the Kegel Kommandos annual Grilled Cheese and Baconstravaganza, your stomach will hate you for days! Qualifying and tryouts on Thursday, August 30th at High Noon.

Stuck for a ride and Uber just seems to be taking too long? Then jump aboard the 'Breakfast at Tiffany's Romantic Rickshaw Ride'. It probably won't take you where you want to go, but boy is it romantic…","Bar open daily from 5pm.....ish......
