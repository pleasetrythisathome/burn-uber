# Uberburn

I'm a clojure(script) dev, but just for shits, here's a purposeful development experiment in pure, dumb javascript for the radical participation of everyone at Burning Man.

Concepted by [Kae Burke](http://houseofyes.org/).
Developed by [Dylan Butman](https://github.com/pleasetrythisathome).
Created together... for Burners and friends.

Made possible by the generous support of [House of Yes](http://houseofyes.org/).
